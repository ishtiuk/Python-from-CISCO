The IBAN Validator
The fourth program implements (in a slightly simplified form) an algorithm used by European banks to specify account numbers. The standard named 
IBAN (International Bank Account Number) provides a simple and fairly reliable method of validating the account numbers against simple typos that 
can occur during rewriting of the number e.g., from paper documents, like invoices or bills, into computers.

You can find more details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number.

An IBAN-compliant account number consists of:

a two-letter country code taken from the ISO 3166-1 standard (e.g., FR for France, GB for Great Britain, DE for Germany, and so on)
two check digits used to perform the validity checks - fast and simple, but not fully reliable, tests, showing whether a number is invalid 
(distorted by a typo) or seems to be good;
the actual account number (up to 30 alphanumeric characters - the length of that part depends on the country)
