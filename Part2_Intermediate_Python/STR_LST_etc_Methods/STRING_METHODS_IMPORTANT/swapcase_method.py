
# NOTE: The swapcase() method
# The swapcase() method makes a new string by swapping the case of all letters within the source string: lower-case characters become upper-case, and vice versa.

# All other characters remain untouched.

# Look at the first example in the editor. Can you guess the output? It won't look good, but you must see it:

# i KNOW THAT i KNOW NOTHING.

print("i KNOW THAT i KNOW NOTHING.".swapcase())
print("I know that I know nothing.".swapcase())
