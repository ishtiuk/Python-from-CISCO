
The Caesar Cipher: encrypting a message
We're going to show you four simple programs in order to present some aspects of string processing in Python. They are purposefully simple, but the lab problems will
 be significantly more complicated.

The first problem we want to show you is called the Caesar cipher - more details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher.

This cipher was (probably) invented and used by Gaius Julius Caesar and his troops during the Gallic Wars. The idea is rather simple - every letter of the message is 
replaced by its nearest consequent (A becomes B, B becomes C, and so on). The only exception is Z, which becomes A.

The program in the editor is a very simple (but working) implementation of the algorithm.

We've written it using the following assumptions:

it accepts Latin letters only (note: the Romans used neither whitespaces nor digits)
all letters of the message are in upper case (note: the Romans knew only capitals)
