
# NOTE: The title() method
# The title() method performs a somewhat similar function - it changes every word's first letter to upper-case, turning all other ones to lower-case.

# Look at the second example in the editor. Can you guess its output? This is the result:

# I Know That I Know Nothing. Part 1.


print("i KNOW THAT i KNOW NOTHING. parT 1.".title())
print("I Know That I Know Nothing. Part 1.")
