
# NOTE: The rstrip() method
# Two variants of the rstrip() method do nearly the same as lstrips, but affect the opposite side of the string.

# Look at the code example in the editor. Can you guess its output? Run the code to check your guesses.

# As usual, we encourage you to experiment with your own examples.


# Demonstrating the rstrip() method:
print("[" + " upsilon ".lstrip() + "]")
print("cisco.com".rstrip(".com"))
