# Both, Level1 and Level2 classes define a method named fun() and a property named var. Does this mean that the Level3 class object will be able to 
# access two copies of each entity? Not at all.

# The entity defined later (in the inheritance sense) overrides the same entity defined earlier. This is why the code produces the following output:
# 200 201
# output

# As you can see, the var class variable and fun() method from the Level2 class override the entities of the same names derived from the Level1 class.
# NOTE: This feature can be intentionally used to modify default (or previously defined) class behaviors when any of its classes needs to act in a different way to its ancestor.
# We can also say that Python looks for an entity from bottom to top, and is fully satisfied with the first entity of the desired name.
