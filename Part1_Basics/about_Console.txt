How to spoil and fix your code
You may have noticed that the error message generated for the previous error is quite different from the first one.

Python 3.7.0 IDLE - Console error message after running a program with removed letter t from the print() function

This is because the nature of the error is different and the error is discovered at a different stage of interpretation.



The editor window will not provide any useful information regarding the error, but the console windows might.

The message (in red) shows (in the subsequent lines):

the traceback (which is the path that the code traverses through different parts of the program - you can ignore it for now, as it is empty in such a simple code);
the location of the error (the name of the file containing the error, line number and module name); note: the number may be misleading, as Python usually shows the place where it first notices the effects of the error, not necessarily the error itself;
the content of the erroneous line; note: IDLE’s editor window doesn’t show line numbers, but it displays the current cursor location at the bottom-right corner; use it to locate the erroneous line in a long source code;
the name of the error and a short explanation.

Experiment with creating new files and running your code. Try to output a different message to the screen, e.g., roar!, meow, or even maybe an oink!. Try to spoil and fix your code - see what happens.
