
# NOTE: The isalpha() method
# The isalpha() method is more specialized - it's interested in letters only.


# Example 1: Demonstrating the isapha() method:
print("Moooo".isalpha())
print('Mu40'.isalpha())



# Look at Example 1 - its output is:

# True
# False
# output

# NOTE: The isdigit() method
# In turn, the isdigit() method looks at digits only - anything else produces False as the result.


# Example 2: Demonstrating the isdigit() method:
print('2018'.isdigit())
print("Year2019".isdigit())



# Look at Example 2 - its output is:

# True
# False
# output

# Carry out more experiments.
